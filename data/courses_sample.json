Racket is restricted by so many things so I feel I lose the freedom of coding. The assignments are extremely hard after midterm, I spent a whole day on them but I can just solve the easiest one. The only positive impression that I have is that the design recipe weighs half so I pass this course successfully."}, {"id": 3, "review": "Took this in 2018 with no programming experience ever.

It's seriously well structured and I would recommend it to anyone even with no background in coding."}, {"id": 5, "review": "I recommend finding a course with a language that is actually useful. Racket is dumb and never used anywhere. The majority of the course was quite easy, except a couple of concept checks that were RIDICULOUSLY HARD. i wish i had realized sooner that you get 10% of concept checks dropped from your grade. if you understand everything and are getting most things easily but you get stumped on one particular concept check, its probably not your fault and you should skip it, at least for now. the course was very well structured and predictable. expectations were clear and reasonable. it actually was designed to be a correspondence course, so it wasnt an online course that was rushed and slapped together for covid."}, {"id": 6, "review": "I really enjoyed this course online, being co-taught by 4 professors. There were lots of office hours available to help and all of the TA's and Profs in office hours were helpful and kind. While the programming language used is not useful elsewhere, I think it is easy to understand and helped get the point of the course across. In my opinion, the point of this course is to teach you to think about solving problems and the process to go through, as you are not creating ground-breaking programs. As a student with no prior programming experience, I found this course both useful and easy if you kept up with the content and got help as soon as you needed it. The course was organized well, and the built in questions made sure you were on the right track. The assignments are fair based on what you learn. Go in with an open mind and keep up with the content and you should be just fine."}, {"id": 7, "review": "math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. the course isn't horribly hard, but if you fall behind or don't understand one lesson, everything following will be super challenging. the course was mostly online completing modules, and my biggest criticism is that solutions for lessons are never posted after they are due which makes it super challenging to do the next week's module if you didn't understand/didnt know how to write a specific code for the week. the racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful and isn't used anywhere. this makes it difficult to find help outside of cs115 profs/ta's/past cs115 students. the course is oddly paced, felt the super easy and simple first half of the course, and then gets unreasonably fast. didn't find any of the profs/ta's answers to questions posted on discussion boards useful at all. because the course was only offered online, I had to essentially had to teach the whole course to myself"}, {"id": 8, "review": "The only way to do bad in this course is by not managing ur time properly. This is a mistake I made when we had to work with modules. As long as u properly manage ur time and do assignments and concept checks well before the due date, you will have a great time in this course. Also try finding connections between assignments and try finding some real world applications of racket. Trust me Racket is very useful. The only criticism I have of this course is how the course is taught because it wasn't taught. (this is when I did online.) I had to understand all concepts by myself by basically reading texts. Although There was plenty of opportunity like office hours to ask for help, I only realized that towards the end of the term.

Overall, as someone who is not a CS student and who doesn't have a lot of background experience and knowledge in programming, it's a great introductory course to the language of Racket and the overall concepts that will be useful in later computer science courses. The Racket language itself is not a very \"useful\" language that you may or may not use in later CS courses and even in a job, but the foundation it provides is very valuable and will definitely make you think more mathematically at programming problems. The difficulty of this course starts to increase after the midterm exam, and it does get pretty tough nearing the end. I recommend starting the assignments as early as possible and attend as many office hours if you have any questions. The course staff are very responsive and do offer a good amount of help depending on your questions.

The EDx is clearly organized, and the content isn't too difficult, but provides a challenge. Can't speak to the in-person, but would definitely recommend the online. Beware though as this course is time consuming because of the amount of problems and assignments and shouldn't be mixed with a term that is already fairly difficult."}, {"id": 14, "review": "This was joint taught by a bunch of profs in the Winter term and I think it was one of the most organized online courses I took. The content modules were all written but there was a bunch of integrated questions to check your understanding. The course is really centered on your ability to reach out for help when you need it since everything was asynchronous. I think my favourite part was how office hours were 1-on-1 and there were a lot of times available throughout the day. The only thing is that some of the nicer TAs had really long wait times lol. Overall super enjoyable though, just make sure to base your design recipe on their given examples or you will lose many marks"}, {"id": 15, "review": "I think this course ran well online, the notes were very organized and easy enough to follow along and there is good support from most of the proffs and tas.

But little annoying that you have to do Design Recipe (especially writing an explanation for codes). There is no loop in DrRacket so being able to understand recursion is important.

So far I think those who can just play computer games (i.e. no coding experience but can easily type using the keyboard) can easily get 90+ in this course. If you have ever coded like C, python, java, pascal and so on, easy to get 95+. Idk why the easy rate goes so low but trust me, super easy course if you finish reading the material (okay reading part may be a little boring and CS 135 provide detailed intros which seem not wordy)"}, {"id": 18, "review": "It was okay. All I can say is, do your work and submit assessments on time. Please don't procrastinate. That's what I did, and I live to regret it.

For me, I believe the material we learn and the assignment we need to do is inconsistent in terms of difficulty level. The gap between them is just huge.

Speaking of assignment, they're bloody hard! No joke, it might take you an entire day to problem solve your way through them and that might not even be enough - incredibly frustrating course and not recommended unless you really want to study coding in the future.

However, that was the most childish a wanna be theoretical physicist can tell himself. A lot of what you will learn in this course will be useful as it will be the foundation of the mathematics you will need to solve a lot of theoretical physics problems. A lot of what u learn in this course is also useful in proving equations u derive as a physicist. You will learn things like Complex numbers, Methods of Proof, The Binomial Theory, Summations and repeated multiplications. All of these concepts are useful for example when we try to approximate equations in Physics, a good understanding of Summations is required. Binomial theory may be used to expand Relativistic kinetic energy equation. Lets say u as a mathematical physicist derived an equation some how. Now u want to make sure that the equation is valid, a basic knowledge of what u learn in this course may be helpful. Complex numbers can be spotted in Schrodinger's Wave Equation. If u are serious about physics, don't take this course lightly. Although this might be an over exaggeration but I feel like this course is as important as Calculus. So In calculus you will be asked to derive Taylor polynomials, how will you do that without a basic understanding of Summations? Although the science mathematical physics students donot have to take this course before taking math 136 (linear algebra for honours math), this course is very useful in math 136. The proof techniques you learn in this course like Proof by Strong induction may be useful in Linear algebra. And all physics enthusiasts know the importance of linear algebra in physics. One can finish most of math 137 (calculus) assignments without having to look at lectures (I donot recommend this) and get a good grade. You cannot even solve the first question in math 135 before fully understanding all concepts in the lectures. I personally very much disliked this course mostly because the math learned was very new compared to what I was taught in school and it was difficult to understand these ideas. But I did enjoy learning about the new concepts. but I understand that the content taught is very important. Therefore, if u are an apprising physicist, take the course seriously. If u like pure math take this course seriously, if u like CS take this course seriously. If u like Finance take this course seriously. If u like painting take this course seriously (u need to understand the golden ratio to figure out how to make ur art perfect). Regardless of ur major, please don't undermine the value this course provides. This course sucks no doubt, but it is hella useful so pay attention in class and do all assignments even though u can drop one. A criticism I would have with this course is the lack of applications. Although this course content has many applications the course is designed in a way that suggests that there is none except in pure math. I would like that to change. And if possible please make a physics based Math135 and math 136 please and thankyou."}, {"id": 33, "review": "Incredibly helpful for anyone who wants to develop a more profound understanding of the fundamental components of algebra."}, {"id": 34, "review": "The most difficult course in my 1A.

This class was an easy ninety, and quite enjoyable as well. All the little proofs they give out are so satisfying to solve -- the same tranquil pleasure of sudoku or a crossword.

The first half of the class teaches you proof techniques and some basic mathematical logic (which you will see again in CS 245), then second half goes into elementary number theory stuff (prime numbers, division theorem, modulo) and complex numbers. The weekly assignments were tough and I always do them 2 or 3 days before deadline so it was not a nice experience at all so my tip is to start them asap and get help from instructor or TA whenever you get dead stuck.

When it goes to Prime Number, there are questions I have no idea to get full marks (question itself is easy to answer, but no idea how to avoid losing partial marks, fortunately, TAs are willing to give full marks) The third part RSA (application on number theory) is really interesting. Overall, easy course with a high grade because there are 2 free bonus marks. The final exam is hard. Some questions you have no idea how to get full marks even if you know how to solve them.

There were a lot of erroneous questions (like two MCQ choices are the same) on the quizzes, midterms and final, and you don't get the answers after each quiz, so overall the quality of the presentation and assessments were likewise nonexistent.

Let me start by outlining my experience regarding content covered in the days leading up to the midterm. Despite its unpopularity among undergrads, the midterm quiz contains only ten multiple choice questions, each worth 20, or 10 marks on the length of the question. Since the course content prior to midterms is centred around advanced stoichiometry that involves the setup of a system of linear equations to form the foundation for solving, it becomes increasingly difficult to make sense of how you are supposed to approach the questions on the quiz. A lot of them involve highly structured calculations where the chance of committing an error increase Due to the fact the entire quiz is multiple choice, even a minor error in calculation can lead you to the wrong final answer, which if included in the list of responses can deliver false hope. If not, you will end up spending 20 minutes trying to locate the error, which can be likened to finding a needle in a haystack. In case that ever happens you, MOVE ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION! Yes, you may have instantly pulverized 20 marks, but what can you do? The course content after midterms is a whole different story. That is when the topics covered appear to be more relevant (to our program at least) and more straightforward to comprehend. Unfortunately, the final exam is still entirely multiple choice; a source of frustration for many, but our professors were generous enough to allow us to redeem ourselves by setting up a stupendously simple and straightforward final exam that allowed us to compensate for our poor performance on the midterm. Finally, the final is non-inclusive; the content covered during lectures leading up to midterms will not be included. TL;DR Course content prior to the midterms is seen to be somewhat challenging, and most undergraduates (including me) are obliterated once we receive our midterm grades. Fortunately, the course is structured to become less rigorous following midterms, and a difficult midterm will be compensated by an easy final in-order t boost the average."}, {"id": 42, "review": "This course only exists really to satisfy professional engineering requirements.

Apparently Trelford's been making the course more proof-based rather than plug n chug styled as of 2017, probably why the 2018 average was pretty bad. The practice test that was sent out was light/medium difficulty and was very doable compared to the exam. Needless to day the fact that most of the exam was proofs rather than computations is probably the reason the average for the final was probably low-mid 50 (out of the 20 people I talked to). Everyone got clapped really hard. If i had to retake the course I would not sleep on the proofs, spanning sets, vector spaces.

For those who have experience coding before, or find mathematics more intuitive than English, you probably won't have a hard time with this course. However, that person is NOT me, so while the first four assignments were relatively okay, most of A05-A09 was difficult for me. This course is particularly dense with material for those new to computer science, so I would recommend studying earlier rather than later. Do NOT procrastinate on the assignments, or else you may be spending Monday night struggling to meet the deadline. If you do the assignments and get high marks on them, you should be relatively okay for the midterms. That being said, the professors this online term were really nice and accommodating. They consistently asked for feedback, were responsive on Piazza, and even gave words of encouragement from time to time. Although I do not know whether what I learned is immediately applicable to other courses, I do feel I gained a better sense of how to approach problems from a systematic perspective. Should you take this course if you're not in the Math faculty? If you're considering going into tech or interested in learning how to code, it's worth a try, even if you have to drop down to CS 115 later on. If you're just looking to fulfill a requirement in your program, I would suggest a different course."}, {"id": 39, "review": "Pretty easy course if you took cs in highschool.

The design recipe is stupid, and I fail to see how it helps. I'd prefer a more flexible documentation style where you don't get marks docked for writing `bool` instead of `Bool`. That said, because of all the bonus, it's quite easy to get a good mark. I'm currently sitting at 100.5%, just after A07 (3 more assignments and the Final to go).

Course organization was atrocious, as previous reviewers have mentioned - if a well-organized basic first-year algebra course was an identity matrix, and MATH 136 from previous terms (assuming neutral levels of organization) was matrix A, then the instruction/organization team multiplied matrix A by itself (instead of its inverse) to get the matrix for the MATH 136 of Winter 2021. Much of this resulted in lack of solutions posted for some assignment questions, which was highly unhelpful for learning and studying purposes. Profs and TAs would give contradicting answers on Piazza and then criticize students for asking the same question (regarding different assignments) - we wouldn't have repeatedly clarified the same question if they were giving a clear, unified answer. However, I'd like to say that I wasn't banned from Piazza for voicing my thoughts (an ~800 word long post with 76 upvotes, summarizing our anguishes regarding unreasonable policies, 80% of an assignment going unmarked, how they were planning to only mark ~half of future assignments but have us do all questions) and raising the issues to MUO.

I really like that the course notes are detailed as well. With that being said here are the things I did not like about the course... The course is basically a \"teach it yourself course\". There are weekly mini lectures you can watch which provide maybe 30-40% of the lesson where as you're expected to read the course notes as well because just going off the mini lectures will not help you with much of the quizzes unfortunately. Meaning that there are quiz topics that aren't covered in the Mobius but that are discussed from the notes. For the assignments, they aren't bad they are just annoying since a lot of it is done in R and I am more of a solve by hand guy rather than software.

I took this course online, so all I had were assignments, quizzes, and a final project. I did the one-person project (I recommend choosing this if you just want to save time).

However, the areas I personally had an annoying time dealing with was our 5th assignment with the Visitor design pattern; and the final project where I had incorporated a massive number of design patterns which sort of increased the complexity since I had to figure out how to make them all fit together. The first 3 assignments were very straightforward and simple. The final 2 ramped up difficulty mainly due to debugging and memory leaks. The difficulty in this course lies with the insane amount of time you have to put in for each assignment. I found that for the 1st assignment, I spent about 6-7 hours on it. Assignment 2 and 3 had me spending about 10-12. Assignment 4 and 5 were between 17-20 hours. The sheer scale of the assignments as they progressed was the primary cause of increased time, the difficulty though didn't really scale all that much. I would advise caution for the final project, you will be better suited with either selecting a game that is done individually or choosing a group of 3. The individual games are meant to be done by a single person... the group games are not... nor should they be by 2 people (as I had). Somehow my partner and I finished our group game in a week and a half when it was meant to be done by 3 within 2 weeks.

The profs for this course will often do review sessions before the midterms and finals, and it's a good idea to attend them because they will go over questions and it's a good opportunity to clarify things you don't understand. They also all record their lectures which is very nice. There is also quite a bit of grade 12 review. If you're thinking about being a keener and buying the textbook, DON'T! Save yourself the money and buy something else!!!! I bought it and barely opened it because we already had so many practice problems available to us.

Bissonnette and Sciaini are great too, but they both post their lectures online as well if you ever need clarification. Participation is 5% of your mark in Lekin's class, and you could choose to either participate in clicker question sessions every Friday or do the online participation quizzes online. She typically would post a video the night before Friday's lecture and make it a very interactive lecture which was a nice way to learn. Online assignments are 10% of your mark, which you can opt out of and have the weight of them transferred to your final exam, however they closely resemble a lot of midterm questions and enhance your understanding so I would recommend you just do them. You get 4 attempts and if you get above 80% they count it as 100%. Easy way to earn 10% of your grade. The first midterm was worth 12% and people typically tend to do worse on because Module 0 isn't covered as heavily in class and is review. The second midterm is 18% and was significantly easier (I was one mark away from perfect) but is much more theory based rather than calculation. The final is worth 55% and I considered it to be fair. I would not recommend buying the textbook for this class, even when I tried to make use of it, the additional review material in the course notes and posted online by profs had it beat.

What's an algo class where you don't have to write lots of algos and prove correctness? Sure, it's easier but my friend said he would have preferred the format here.

The questions tested understanding of the major algorithm design strategies, and of reductions; not a lot of memorization needed if you did all the assignments and/or read and understood the answers.

I understand why the university uses it, but it often logs the user out while they are working, which is incredibly annoying. Also, the office hours were horrendous all around. Unlike cs135, where each student took 5 minutes tops and there were enough instructors and TA/ISAs to deal with the demand, often there is only one teacher, and each student takes around 15 minutes. As a result, unless you jump into the queue exactly when the office hours start, expect to wait an hour or two for your turn, or not get a turn at all (one time, I waited over 3 hours in line after joining the queue within the first 15 minutes and I never got my turn.)

Knowing how pointers and dynamic memory works are super useful in the workplace and this course did an amazing job at teaching them. The assignments were fair in my opinion.

One thing that I did not love was the quizzes as part of the midterm and final, they were fair but I would prefer them to be strictly coding. Over all a super useful course and if you manage your time well, you can do really well, I ended off with a 96+."}, {"id": 24, "review": "One of the most well-structured online courses I have been a part of. The course notes and the accompanying voiceover videos for each topic are so well designed that concepts such as linked lists and binary trees (whose implementation I found rather confusing before) came quite naturally to me. Assignments are the best thing about this course. They're actually fun, and you produce tangible results most of the time. I've found myself writing modules for assignment question which I can use on my personal projects as well. Assignments do hog up a lot of time, so make sure to start them early! Course staff is amazing. Dismissing the useless Piazza dramas that occurred once or twice during the term, the marking for this course was fair and the exam difficulty was apt.

The assignments were very challenging esp for a complete beginner with only cs135 programming knowledge. I wished I had taken cs116 before even though it would have made me a bit late on schedule. I had a 89% average on cs135 and thought I would do fine in cs136 but god I was wrong. Had a mental breakdown with this course since I understood the theory, understood what was asked to do for the assignments but simply didn't understand how to implement these things into my program. I found that during the first half of the course, there were not enough examples on how to use some functions in your program but it became much better in the second half of the course (even though the content became much more difficult) I failed 4 of the assignments but managed to get a 54% average on all assignments. The final exam took me nearly 15 hours to code but I managed to do every question. My advice for this course is to go to office hours, esp 1-1 if you're like me and are afraid to ask questions in front of others. These office hours were soo helpful to understand the concepts and the TAs ISAs and Instructors really try to help you debug your code, understand what exactly the question requires from you and can explain the concepts in a different way to help you understand. I finally liked the course in the end even if it was a nightmare at the beginning."}, {"id": 26, "review": "This course took forever. Nearly every assignment took 10+ hours to complete, and I know this was a commonality amongst students as office hours regularly had three hour wait times, with most people not ever getting help.

I am a slow reader so having good lecture video is wonderful for me. The first half of the class was chill, nothing too interesting. The content got really interesting after dynamic memory.

This was my second attempt at the course and I passed! The course was fair and well organized. There were weekly tutorials that we work on as a group and a weekly tutorial meeting to present our solutions. That helped enforce my understanding of the course material on top of the assignments. There were 2 tough assignments but I found the rest to be fair and excellent at helping me understand course materials. The midterm average was low, around 57, but I found it to be very fair and there were no tricky (or any very unfamiliar) questions at all. The exam was also very fair, none of the questions asked were too tough or tricky except maybe for one. I really appreciate how the course was run this term. I found enumeration a bit easier than graph theory. Mainly because I just suck at proof. Although I only found the last chapter on matching and the first few sections related to path and connectedness to be tough to find proof for. Bijective proofs on enumeration were tough but it's not too bad. Some people found this course very interesting and loved it, some did not like it at all. I'm kind of in-between, I found it nice to learn something very different from what I'm used to (linear alg, calc..) and I believe graph theory is very useful for CS. But like one of the other commenters said, I also found it tough to stay focused and put in the work to study in a course with not much applications. If math 239 is not a required course for your degree and you are considering whether to take this or not, I say give it a try. The first week jumps right into bijective proofs so you get a taste of how tough it is right away. Compare this to the first time I took the course in Spring 2021, huge difference. I hated the Spring 2021 offering, I won't go into details about why but you can scroll down and see the reviews people wrote for that offering and on Reddit too. But TLDR: profs in spring 2021 did not bother going on the piazza and helping students, tests were difficult as hell (1 hour for 3 very tough questions), I dropped before the day of Test 3 but the first 2 tests were rough. Assignments were biweekly instead of weekly like in Winter 2022, so some course contents weren't even covered on assignments but on tests instead and they were tough as hell.

Extremely harsh marking with absolutely no mercy. We were all basically teaching ourselves this entire course, which in a regular term is difficult enough, only to be thrown curve balls at every opportunity by the professors and teaching staff. Never have I felt such a passionate disdain for such a course in Waterloo or school in general. I've had previous anxiety problems resurface because of the gross negligence of the professors who taught this course - do avoid them at all costs.

Presumably to stop cheating, but I would guess it would help cheaters who were able to get a question paper beforehand, because if you had seen the questions before the super-strict time limits might seem a lot more reasonable. Even profs had trouble solving practice problems in office hours. The lectures were all old and reused from previous terms, which were great. I really enjoyed the content.

The instructors do not answer questions on Piazza, instead they host office hours where you can ask your questions. Make sure to go to these office hours early in the week and not the night before an assignment is due. Assignments were difficult due to inconsistent marking schemes and poor communication from the instructors. This is caused by the very limited communication between instructors and students since instructors seem to communicate only through office hours and private e-mails. The course also has three midterms (or tests, as they call it). These tests aim to assess students' knowledge of the previous 3 or 4 weeks content. Many students including myself found the time limit (60 minutes + 20 minutes for uploading) to be not enough for these types of questions.

Both of their slides have primarily images: to do well, you HAVE to listen to the lectures, especially if you do not want to buy the textbook. Personally, the textbook was useful for me. The profs referred to specific figure numbers (images) in the textbook, and hence reading the captions under those images in the textbook were useful when re-writing summary notes for each unit.

Tips for studying include reviewing lecture notes, attempt to create questions based on the theory, and make study notes. Assignments: Assignments 1-5 were independent of each other, and covered the content from the week they were assigned. Don't take too much time so try and get them done as fast as possible. A3 and A4 were probably the hardest in the first half, but manageable if you review the lecture properly. Object Oriented mindset is a necessity. Assignments 6-10 were a series of assignments based on the previous assignment (or at least parts of it were). Make sure you complete the key questions in order to do well on the assignment. Conclusion: Great course for learning the ins and outs of how to do OOP properly, as well as how a computer works.

With good time management, you could be complete with the week\u2019s work by Tuesday with content posted on Monday. It can be annoying dealing with the weekly bonus participation challenges but push through and just do it! The marks will be worth it! Your future self will thank you. I did not complete the final ~3-4% bonus assignment at the end of the term and I lowkey regret it. Could have finished with a 95% rather than a 91%.

The course consisted of five labs, each with a pre-lab quiz to be completed 24 hours ahead of the scheduled lab session, writing out the procedure for the lab before starting the experiment, and a lab report. Only one of the lab reports was formal (which took about a dozen hours to finish) and it was not too bad, although I do not recommend pulling off an all nighter to finish it like I did.

MATH 127 starts off with very simple content by first covering the basics of functions, which should've been covered in grade 11. It then moves into limits and derivatives which is covered in grade 12. Finally, the course ends with integration, which should be the only new topic that is presented in the course. Essentially, around 3/4 of this course is covered in high school with a little more toughness in the test questions. I personally found this course to be on the easier side but it gets confusing at the end of the term with the new integration content. A few tips for this course is to do the practice midterm and exam problems that are provided, it is highly likely that a question or two from the practice problem sheet may show up on an assessment, or a question very similar. Attend office hours if you are confused. University math can be a big jump for people and topics can be hard to understand, which is why asking your professor/TA is the best option to clear up any confusion and will only benefit you in the end.

There was also a practise midterm to test yourself and a journal to keep yourself on track. Overall the course was pretty easy as it was just a repeat of grade 12 calc with one additional unit on integrals at the very end. The online video lectures, however, were almost incomprehensible. It took so long to understand, your better off referring to free textbooks online or searching up concepts on youtube. I only used this for the integral lecture but if you didn't take calc in grade 12 you should probably make sure to do so just to ensure you understand concepts completely.

Pre-midterm material (minterms, maxterms, SOP/POS, K-maps, some circuit design) is pretty straightforward. Post-midterm material, which features the analysis and synthesis of asynchronous and synchronous sequential circuits, is a bit trickier, but just figure out how to apply the different algorithms and you should be fine.

It's like they delight in screwing over hapless students because they're angry at the world or something. Or maybe it's personal and they just hate me. As an example, I lost nearly all marks on a long question because the TA had a bone to pick with the way I described a certain situation, so they took off marks for every single instance where I did it.

The questions on the timed quizzes each week were tricky since they would not directly replicate the problems that were solved in the lessons, so you would really need to UNDERSTAND the concept and not just memorize solutions to questions.

You should take advantage of the tutorial and use it as a mark booster. The content of the course is a mix of high school review with a bit of new stuff, and the focus is less on mass memorization and more on application of concepts than your typical biology course. Everything you need to know is in Christine's slides (though they may seem a bit sparse). Don't forget to study the diagrams, as they get VERY important in the later units involving experiments and laboratory processes. Easier than BIOL 130 if you've taken that as Christine doesn't try as hard to trick you on the multiple choice as Heidi did in 130 (ex/ there are very rarely \"a and b\" or \"a and c\" options) and because Christine doesn't say things not on the slideshows which end up being tested like Heidi did. Not to say that Christine's tests are easy...fair is the best way to describe them. Also, on top of this already generous marking scheme, you get an extra 5% tacked onto your mark for buying the online textbook and completing the practice qs *cough* or just do all the qs in the free 2 week trial and save yourself $100 *cough*. Midterm average was 73, exam average was 61. This seems pretty low but I still believe both were fair. Despite this, the class average was definitely much higher because of tutorial and bonus 5%, so you only need to do meh on the midterm/exam to get a good mark. Based on all of this, a high 80 is very doable if you don't go to class and just grind Christine's podcasts and really are able to do her practice qs. If you actually put a lot of work in, 90 is easy (85% mark + 5% bonus).

The first formal lab report was graded extremely hard and i lost a lot of points for things that weren't made clear to us. my TA legitimately told me that the course was designed to have people do really bad on the first lab and then have to fix things for the second one, which i think is a very poor excuse for not making their expectations and requirements (for both small and big details) clear to us. there was often experiments that didn't work out well yet we were expected to get correct answers given wrong or often nonexistent information.

I almost bombed the first lab report but got almost perfect on the second one so I cant complain too much.

This resulted in 7 weeks of rushed lab reports (1 per week), when the 3 weeks from the beginning of the semester could have allowed for students to complete formal lab reports with some more time (especially considering they were worth 10 and 20%, respectively). Furthermore, there was inconsistency between the information each of the TAs were giving out. I found that my peers got more useful information than I did; things that my TA said she couldn't help me with were covered by other TAs.

The first lab was a bonus exercise where you learn how to craft a university biology lab (hyperlink, the fact that you can't have vertical lines in your tables or cite any websites). From then on you were to summarize the procedure in a flow chart in your green biology lab book (which you have to purchase from the STC media doc and must write in it in pen in order to receive a full 5% for your lab book check). You would have to complete 7 labs quizzes before your lab from which they take your 5 best marks. The quizzes can be fairly challenging and specific so make sure you really understand the content before attempting them! They have a time limit of 15 minutes which can be pretty tight, but won't sign you out automatically at 15 minutes, instead you have to submit the quiz yourself and have a two minute grace period, otherwise you get a zero on the lab.

You learn how to deal with problems that you previously didn't know existed, like how to schedule threads to run so that they appear concurrent, or how to manage virtual memory to reduce fragmentation and speed up memory translations.

Students were required to do a quiz before each lecture and to read the course notes. The lectures were very interesting, however oftentimes I found them to not be needed, as the course notes already explained all the concepts very well. The lectures are great for getting some extra practice with proofs, as all you really do in the lectures are taking up quiz questions, and doing complicated proofs in groups based on material from the notes.

Secondly, do not JUST do the assignments and think you know your stuff; study them. Make sure you test your own code, and understand edge cases.

Do not just assume you know your stuff heading into the midterm and final; even if you're a well-seasoned programmer, spend a few hours in study.

The final exam is much easier than the midterm and an overall 80%+ in this course is very achievable. Personally, I found it most helpful to attend lecture and just listen and then rewatch the videos and take notes from that since I could understand the material at my own pace. Neufeld also uploads practice quizzes (doesn't count towards grades) to help you review material for each powerpoint. These are somewhat helpful, and most of the questions come straight from the textbook. You DO NOT need to purchase a textbook for the course.

I.E., the assignments and midterm/final exams are marked harshly. I don't think they reflect well on what I learned in this course. With all due respect, this content is interesting and probably useful to some extent. However, since it is all about uC++, it is not so practical. On the other hand, grading is just ridiculous. There are many ways you can lose points. For example, an inconsistent indentation or a \"wrong\" naming will result in a \"-5\", and the total score for the assignment is usually around 100. The professors are very passionate (especially Mr. Buhr), and I wouldn't doubt that. But most of the answers they answered on Piazza were not helpful at all (especially Mr. Buhr). Basically, these lectures are just documentation about what uC++ is and why it is the way it is. So, after you watched (went to) all the lectures, you will find that the content itself is not that difficult. However, you can still spend a lot of time debugging it, because there are some pitfalls in uC++ if you don't pay attention (some of them are a.k.a. \"the known issues\" to the teaching team but not students). Also, since uC++ is based on C++, you know that debugging some issues can be very time-consuming. In addition to that, you will spend a lot of time writing or debugging code that has absolutely nothing to do with concurrency, because the assignments will always require you to handle special inputs. You should be very careful with this part because if your program doesn't handle all the invalid inputs correctly, you will probably fail the assignment (even though they say the testing part does not worth much in marking, which is a lie). This makes me feel it is a \"practical\" testing course. If you don't need to take this class (not from SE), then please don't take it. After all, what they teach in this class will have little (if any) impact on how you code in the future. But I have to admit, I did enjoy it. However, if you ask me if I would have taken this course if I knew what it was like, then I definitely would not take it."}, {"id": 1, "review": "Since no language implements all of the concurrency constructs taught in the course, the course is instead taught using uC++, a custom version of C++ that is absolute hell to debug. The assignments also expect you to implement argument parsing and error-checking and provide extensive testing documentation. Therefore, even though the course is *supposed* to teach concurrency, 50% of it ends up being uC++ trivia or programming/debugging code unrelated to the actual course material."}, {"id": 2, "review": "The worst CS course I've taken at Waterloo.

Half of the course content will leave you wondering why your time is being wasted learning this junk. The other half is covered in CS 350. The assignments are a little long, mostly extended by the fact that a large chunk of your time will be dedicated to trying to decipher what he actually wants you to do from the assignment outline. On piazza the prof and even the TAs are so intentionally obtuse and condescending to the point where you wonder if they have a bet going on who can be the worst. If I hear this guy say \"automagically\" one more time I'm going to lose my mind.

Peter Bhur is an incredible lecturer, but his concurrency methods are irrelevant. Most of what you will learn in this course is not used in practice, usually because they are too complicated/incomprehensible, but sometimes because it's just not how people implemented it. There's a lot of cool little facts you'll learn in the course, but most of them are just little tidbits of knowledge that you talk about with people to impress them (did you know C can handle most exceptions?), and aren't useful. I honestly don't believe I've learned anything RELEVANT about concurrency that I didn't know already. The assignments in this course were the worst assignments I've ever had. About 70-80% of the time spent working on them was spent building time wasting things like output generators or trying to parse what the assignment was even asking. None of the assignment questions were hard, they were just time consuming, in the worst way. There was also no opportunity for creativity in problem solving; you were told exactly what to do, and exactly how to do it (usually in very confusing language), and any deviation would lose you marks. The marking on the assignments was insane. You will have marks taken off for things that aren't WRONG, but Buhr didn't do it that way, so you lose marks. You will lose marks for putting code in one perfectly reasonable place when Buhr put it somewhere else. You will lose marks for formatting your code differently that Buhr formats his code. I submitted an answer for a theoretical question once, in which you can come up with two different answers depending on how your interpret the problem, and submitted a full proof, and I got 30% on the question because Buhr got the other answer. They didn't say or explain why they thought my proof was wrong; I was simply wrong because Buhr did it another way. We also need to talk about micro C++. This is Buhr's language that he designed for concurrency, but nobody uses, except for this course. You'll quickly learn there are very good reasons nobody uses the language. The syntax is pretty bad, and there is essentially no documentation or help out there except for the documentation Buhr has. The language also has it's share of errors and bugs, which Buhr will most likely find throughout the term. I have counted 11 errors in the language that were solved by just remaking. In the end, I feel sad about this course. Concurrency is a very interesting topic, and Buhr is honestly the best lecturer I've ever had. If he took that passion and applied it to teaching useful things, and let someone else make and mark the assignments, I could have really loved this course.

A big reason is that it's very textbook-heavy! I had Vivian and she uses a lot of info from the textbook into the test and final as well as a lot of application questions. I highly doubt anyone would pass this course without the textbook. luckily it's free online. 2. What I wish I had known was to do the homework questions provided in the textbook after every chapter before attempting her quizzes, midterms and tests. She really does base her questions off of them, sometimes they are the exact same questions. I did them last minute before taking the final and not even kidding some of them were exactly the same. Again this is not the only thing you should rely on. A lot of her questions are application based and you really need to grasp the concept to answer those. 3. The information in this course can get overwhelming with the number of pages from the textbook to read. I recommend reading at least 6-7 pages after watching every individual lecture that way you do not cram 300 pages before a midterm or final. Plus 20% of your mark is doing assignments from the textbook so dividing your readings like this will really be useful for that."}, {"id": 3, "review": "Took this course online and I really enjoyed learning the content.

Finished the class with 87 (better than expected). The final exam was fair it was very similar to the 3 practice term tests provided. Like 80% of the final exam was based on content after module 7.

First of all, it is possible to do well. However, to do well you really need to understand what you're being taught. You can go to class, absorb the knowledge they give you, but you really need to practice, practice, practice. It is easy to say you understand something, but all too many times do people think they know something, when in reality they don't. Hence the reason for the 60% average on midterms. My biggest pieces of advice for this course are as follows: (1). Buy the textbook (TopHat). It provides an online code for interactive quiz like questions. Practice, practice, and practice some more with those questions. (2). Buy the more expensive model kit. It's something like 40$, but wow does it come to save the day. Also, understand how to use the model kit. Don't just willy-nilly come into the midterm thinking you'll be able to know how to use it. Spend some time with it, practice some questions making models with the sticks and balls. (3). Go to office hours. I had Forsey, he was a charm and made understand some concepts pretty easy by going to him. Also, emailing him (or I am sure the other coordinator) is also very useful. He is pretty fast in responses. I was never really good at chemistry in high school or even the 100 level chemistry courses most people take, but I am expecting at least a 90 after the final. However, like Forsey says in class, \"It's memorization with understanding\". Memorize a few rules (well there is definitely a lot but it is manageable), and with a decent amount of practice you can get it down and do well. Is organic chemistry easy? No. I'm not going to sugar coat it. However, know you can do well, it is possible and it is manageable. No one is going to hand you free marks. Study, hustle, and you can definitely expect results (this feels like a motivational speech or something lol). Best of luck, you can do it!"}, {"id": 15, "review": "I've always been bad at chemistry so the difficulty of this course for me was not a surprise. The course went much too quickly for me to keep up and I'd come out of lecture more confused than I was before.

The heart attacks you experience every midterm is worth the thrill. All my friends and myself received 50%-60% on each midterm (you can't get any higher than that unless you're morn smart). The prof congratulates the class on the 60% midterm average, meaning that she thinks the course is too easy for everyone's liking and perhaps the midterms must be made even harder to ensure a 50% average. The best way to prepare for this course is to not be taking any other courses except this one, as the profs go so fast and cover so much content in one lecture ,that no one knows what is ever going on, and most people are often 3 chapters behind at all times. Perhaps if you dedicated 100% of your time to this course, you can get a decent mark. Thus ,it is best to take it in summer when you have no other courses to take up your time, except this course is purposely only offered in winter so that those who fail (and there is about a 15% fail rate every year) must take it again the next fall, and cannot take chem 267 without it."}, {"id": 33, "review": "If you read the course notes before class and stay on top of things, it's really not hard to do well in this course!"}, {"id": 34, "review": "Orgo I wasn't as bad as everyone told me it would be.

Midterms are mc, tf, and choose 3-4 short answer from 8-9 options given. He tells you the short answer questions the lecture before the test, and he also even tells you a few mc/tf. Although *hint* if you look, you'll definitely be able to find more questions than these... Attendance not mandatory, but useful the lecture before the test for reasons listed above. Also, I didn't find the material as dry as others, and it's actually pretty useful because no matter where you work, things like labour legislation are guaranteed to affect you. Guaranteed 80, easy 85, easy 90 if you grind the questions he tells you (and possibly more questions you can find..hint) for a few days before the midterms. Midterms are on Tuesdays so if you dedicate the weekend to grinding the questions, you're set. Online version has an exam and a relatively large assignment but only one midterm, so it's probably a worse mark but I guess slightly less work during the semester? Highly recommend in class version.

With that in mind Seeing as I receive a different TA marking my assignments each time, the overall requirements do not even matter when the TAs have there own preferences. The communication of content and ideas related to concepts taught in PHYS 111 is horrendous. Yes I got to conduct cool experiments which I enjoyed but there weren't any set in stone guidelines for what values to include in your lab report. The whole premise behind this course is that it gives you the freedom to examine and improve your experiment but that idea is really just a fa\u00e7ade. If you don't like physics do not take this course. If physics is your forte, go for it! The content is just 5 labs but the TAs/instructor barely communicate the proper guidelines as if they want you to fail and retake it again. It only thing I really learned was how to apply physics equations to real life matters which really is not unique or mind blowing in any sense. My last words of advice, if you are planning on taking this course and you are not well rounded in PHYS 111 AVOID at all COUNTS. If you are planning on going to med school, Biomedical sciences at waterloo is great but Biology would be a better choice. (Yes there is physics on the mcat but it is better to review these concepts on your own time rather then risk you own GPA with disorganized courses like these.)

The funny thing is they don't tell you if your improvement is wrong or anything during the meeting. In fact, they agree to use the improvement, but then take off marks on the lab report because the proposal isn't \"strong\" enough. They never tell you what is considered a strong improvement until the fourth lab. Not to mention the marking is very subjective depending on which ta you have.

The entire lab course is so disorganized to the point where the Lab TA's didn't know what to do sometimes. Also, a good thing to know before you take this course is you're expected to do the lab, complete the calculations, and hand in a completed lab report with a discussion and conclusion before the end of the 3 hour lab period."}, {"id": 14, "review": "very TA dependent. I got an amazing TA who was a fair marker and also was really good at explaining things. This is such a stressful lab simply because you have to write the lab report during the lab time. It's a time crunch but it's doable."}, {"id": 15, "review": "Highllyyyy TA dependent cuz you will never see Dr Tan Dinh lmao. I think I saw him walk in and out of our class like once. Pray for a knowledgable TA because otherwise you're screwed. My TA was clear but a hard marker (which I rather have than vice versa). Try to do the experiment as quickly as possible because graphing and calculating uncertainties for everything will take up the rest of the class. Everyone basically rushed at the end because I don't think enough time is given. However, since I was learning basically nothing in PHYS 111, this course was useful in understanding the overlapping concepts. Idk if this course is curved or what because I calculated my mark to be a 76 but ended with an 82 :)"}, {"id": 16, "review": "the labs are okay, but the thing that sucked was that not only did you have to complete the experiment in the 3 hours, but also the post lab report. how well you do is quite dependent on your TA and if they're a hard marker or not. you never see the lab instructor himself, labs are run by the TA's. going over the lab and doing as much of it as you can before the actual lab will help save time so you can finish it. also the open lab experiments are useful to go to to see what it is you're working with in the next lab."}, {"id": 17, "review": "pray u get a good TA"}, {"id": 18, "review": "They make you do everything in the 3-hour lab period, which is almost impossible considering you have to run the experiment, analyze the data, and calculate uncertainties.

Kinematics, addition of vectors, forces, and energy."}, {"id": 19, "review": "The lab itself wasn't hard, getting the report done in the allotted time period wasn't hard, what was difficult was including all of the stupid calculations they wanted for error propagation and uncertainty that aren't included in the actual manual. If it wasn't for including uncertainties for every little thing I could've been out with an hour to spare. Beyond the uncertainty though, the labs themselves were easy and if you . and your partner have the mindset of in-n-out then you shouldn't have a problem. Make sure you do as much as you can ahead of time. I'd even go as far as writing out my conclusion and leaving blank spaces for my values throughout just so I'd have as much extra time as necessary. I also would suggest taking this lab as a night lab just because those classes are usually smaller and sometimes TAs actually feel for you more and give you extra time. Our TA in the night lab let us stay until 10:10 sometimes and it didn't negatively impact our mark whatsoever. If you put the effort in you can get a 90+. I'm finishing with a 93 in the lab despite finding the course ridiculously difficult."}, {"id": 20, "review": "You have to finish the lab report by the end of the session. First two labs were manageable and understandable if you spend a few hours reading the manual and attending the prelab to understand the equipment you are working with... Afterwards, you are required to do a std. deviation analysis on large data sets IN CLASS BY HAND! Tbh how could you possibly finish everything in 2h50min, when you have to do the experiment, analyse so much data, and explain it too! In the last 3 labs I found myself scrambling to piece the report together. I was blessed that one of my TAs is very smart and knows the experiment inside out, but too bad the amount of time given is way too little to complete the report even if you prepare ahead of time. The labs are too math intensive to be finished in time. So my tip would be to get as many marks as possible in the first 2 labs and just do the best you could in the last 3. For the parts you don't finish, do a sample calculation and explain your thought process. But other than that, might just have to pray you get a good TA... First year physics lab in UW kinda sucks."}, {"id": 21, "review": "Starting from the third lab... there's literally little to no time to write a proper report after the experiments.

The lab manual is confusing and hard to follow, and I feel bad for the TAs in this lab because most people don't really know what they're doing, and so they're VERY often needed. Hopefully you get a good TA who knows what's going on!! The 3 hours in this lab consisted of being very confused, and scrambling to finish the lab report, since they are due at the end of the lab. However, because they are due at the end of the lab, you don't need to work on them outside of the lab! It's a good idea to prep for the lab in advance though so you at least KIND OF know what you're doing ... Be warned, the first lab IS an actual lab so you need to be ready! (unlike CHEM 123L and BIOL 130L where the first labs were just introductions and no experiments were done) Also after the first 2 labs you will need to make your own data tables. My partner and I would share the work of making the tables by making them on Google docs but leaving blank spaces where we could fill in calculations and our data.

The good thing about this lab is that you don't really have to think about anything.. you just mindlessly follow instructions in the manual and use equations that you may encounter as a quantum physics phD student at Harvard. As my nanna used to always say; ''aim high and shoot low''. You hope for an 80 in the lab, but realistically you pray for a 55. The final lab exam has an average of about 30%?. It really just involves you memorizing the slope of the log plots of each experiment,, which you didn't even do in the first place."}, {"id": 30, "review": "Honestly...my whole class had a really hard time understanding our TA because he did not speak/ understand english very well.

When it comes to the exam, you just have to memorize the formulas and wing it."}, {"id": 31, "review": "I don't know if it was just my TA or if everyone else had bad ones...I found this lab to be pretty straightforward. You have to make sure you have a decent understanding before doing the actual lab (in other words, read over the lab procedures before the day of the lab). The first lab will probably catch people off guard because they kind of just throw you in there, but the labs after that aren't bad at all. HOWEVER, if you are a slow writer/or if it takes you a long time to finish the actual lab in order to record data, I can see why you would hate this lab. Being an efficient worker, properly organizing your data collected, and being able to write a decent conclusion/error analysis in half an hour is pretty essential. If you can do this then netting at least an 80 for your reports shouldn't be a problem. Also 90 percent of the \"reports\" you do are filling in the blanks and filling up tables. Be wary of the final though..."}, {"id": 32, "review": "Wish they could make it clear how to write the report before I lost all the marks.

I had a TA who could not speak English very well so that miscommunication lost me marks on some experiments which was annoying . The labs were always rushed and there was a frenzied panic at the end of a session to finish a bogus discussion and conclusion, and there was always something that screwed me out of a couple percentage points for each experiment. The exam was also bad. The vaguest of suggestions to study for the exam was given, namely: \"Just study the theory behind the experiments\". I did not study for the exam as long as I would have liked to (mostly from sleep deprivation causing me to sleep in later than I should have on exam day), and by some stroke of luck I managed to pass the course with an 80%, so I am really glad that happened. I thought that I had bombed the final. Overall, I disliked the lab and everyone I spoke to felt the same way.

Allow me to tell you the tale of STAT 202, Fall 2018. Riley Metzger, later known as the Ghost of Riley, taught both sections of the course by himself for about 2 weeks before he got AIDS or something and completely disappeared without explanation. The good thing about Riley was his grade breakdown was very easy. NO EXAM, 3 NON-CUMULATIVE midterms worth 20% each, 10% in-class clickers (2/5 marks for an incorrect answer, 5/5 for correct). 10% tutorial clickers (same marking scheme). Also, clicker grades get multiplied by 1.15 at the end, and there's a 40 mark bonus that goes into the in class clicker if you register by a certain date. 10% online quizzes with unlimited attempts. 10% assignments (best 3/4 taken, later changed to 2/3 [foreshadowing how this course ran]). Essentially, this was not only a free 40%, but more. For example, my final clicker grade was about 125%. You could basically get an 85 in this class without knowing any statistics (believe me), provided you take advantage of the free 40. This was the only good thing about Riley. To offset this, it was very clear that Riley intended to make the midterms absolute slaughters. He did not plan on giving us any formulas, and his examples in class were way too simple, and you could tell he was gonna make them much more difficult on the tests. Also, Riley tried to have us learn R (a programming language) in the tutorials, which appeared on midterms. This class was 99% science students with 0 interest in programming, so I'm not sure what he was thinking. I could write a dissertation about only how useless and disorganized the R tutorials were. Once Riley got AIDS though, the course was taken over by Dina Dawoud and James Adcock. Both of them did a fine job considering how abruptly they were thrust into running someone else's course. Also, they realized that Riley not giving us a formula sheet violated the Geneva Convention and decided to bless us with one. Riley seemingly was too ill to contribute to midterm 1, evidenced by his name not being on it, as it was very straightforward and the class average was high (78). Apparently his AIDS symptoms regressed in time for midterm 2, but the AIDS also became contagious, because midterms 2 and 3 had his name and were much, much harder (averages were 69 after a denominator drop, and 63). I can only imagine how low the averages would have been if only Riley wrote them and we were not given formula sheets. Riley also apparently did not create the assignments for this course ahead of time, as Dina and James did not give a fourth one to us. Overall, this course was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Simultaneously the easiest, most low-effort mark I have ever gotten, yet the most irritated I have ever been at a course."}, {"id": 16, "review": "riley metzger ruined this course for me, avoid @ all costs. tests are hard yet he teaches everything in a simple manner..."}, {"id": 17, "review": "Class was basic probability and statistics.

The instructors for this course were Leanne Racicot and Braden John Kralt. The mark breakdown of this course is as follows: 10% performance grade, 15% online pre-lab quizzes with two attempts each, and 75% informal lab reports spread across multiple experiments. No final exam. This is a bi-weekly lab and there are 5 experiments in total. Unlike CHEM 120L and CHEM 123L, there is no lab manual for this course. Everything is completely online. The performance grade (like the general first-year chemistry labs) is out of 10 for each experiment and it is generally very easy to get full marks as long as you a) work safely, b) are able to recover the product, and c) include everything that is required for the procedure summary (more on this in a bit). Before each lab session, you are required to read a procedure workbook (which again, is online). It contains all the instructions and background info you will need, as well as questions that you will need to answer via Mobius. You are allowed two attempts for each procedure workbook. The first page of each procedure workbook contains very general directions, but some will specify certain things that you MUST include in your procedure summary (or else you will lose marks for your lab performance grade for that experiment). For example, the last 3 experiments required you to draw the reaction mechanism for what was going on in the experiment, as well as any specific quantities needed (marked for completion only). The lab reports for CHEM 266L are completely different from the first-year courses. They are all informal and template style, meaning that you download each page and type/draw your answers into the text boxes provided. However, do not alter the font size or enlarge the box sizes or else you will be penalized for it. The due date is always one week after you've completed the experiment at 4:00 pm via Crowdmark. Depending on how familiar you are with the concepts and questions asked, it could take you anywhere from a couple of hours to multiple days to complete them. I found some of the questions to be quite challenging as they really test your creative thinking and knowledge, and people generally didn't do too well on them (high 60s to low 70s averages for each report, at least for my section). One other thing to note is that the TAs who mark your answers are EXTREMELY picky about what you must include for each question (each TA marks a different page so that the marks are more fair). For many of the concept based questions, it's either you get full marks for the question, or no marks. The labs in general were extremely fun to do and most shouldn't take more than a couple of hours each. The TAs and lab instructors (we had two, so the other one took over starting with experiment 4) were very chill, so don't be afraid to ask them questions.

Summative was to design a research study (20% of final grade). The prof speaks super slow and you aren't able to speed up the online lecture videos which is frustrating. The prof wasn't very approachable. They wouldn't let us answer the discussion posts of others, but would commonly answer questions with, \"It's in the syllabus\" or \" It's in the announcements\". Didn't have tolerance for questions for the most part. Least favourite psych course out of the main ones for the psych major.

There is also one main assignment due on the last day of class where u have to summarize an article and make it into a parenting magazine. I literally just taught myself everything before the 2 midterms by reading the textbook because the slides have very little detail. Overall if you are looking for an easy mark booster elective that does not require much work, I do NOT recommend this course, at least not with Pamela Seeds.

The Coq (proof-assistant based) problems are very intimidating for the first few weeks, seemingly taking up a lot of time and effort.

The numerical problems award you for the amount of insight that you give, so it can be de-motivating at times when you can't find conjectures or proofs to conjectures you make. However, his model of discovering -> teaching -> applying is so underrated and essential for deepening your understanding in mathematics. This course has given me new confidence and insight in my mathematical abilities and thinking, as the amount of work you put in truly rewards you that much.

It is a significant time commitment (Prof. Jao expects ~15hrs a week) but I think it is worth it. Lectures were great, very engaging. Jao is an excellent speaker and a very knowledgeable guy. I learned a lot and they were very memorable. Assignments are approximately 70% Coq proofs and 30% \"numericals\". Coq (computer-assisted) proofs are really fun and relatively easy to do once you get the hang of them. Don't be scared of the syntax or get intimidated at the beginning; it gets much easier as you get used to it. With Coq, you will discover exactly what \"rigorous\" really means. I know many classmates who wish they could use Coq in other classes because it makes them feel more confident in the correctness of their proof. The numericals are, as one reviewer put it, \"a different beast\". You will probably spend more time on them than on the Coq proofs even though they are worth less. The premise of the numerical is that you are given a concept and some guiding questions about the concept, and you are asked to: 1. Provide correct answers to the guiding questions (which are typically pretty easy) for 40% of the marks 2. Extend your understanding by asking your own questions, doing your own testing with the concepts, and then coming up with conjectures, definitions, and proofs of your own for the patterns you find in your own exploration (60%) This second task will take a long-ass time if you do it properly. But it is very rewarding and there is really no other course where you will get the same opportunity to explore content on your own and try to make your own conjectures for marks. It teaches you a lot about the essence of doing math research and it is also a lot of fun. It is considerably more creative than one might expect. Anecdotally, you can get a very good mark on numericals without proving a single thing; just finding cool patterns in the concepts and stating them. Overall, nice course!"}, {"id": 8, "review": "This is an extremely interesting and unique course if taken with David Jao. You will learn how to rigorously build up the integers and many of their properties (and properties of rings/fields in general) using the proof assistant coq.

The Racket component (~60%) is where the fun starts: there are assignments on compilers and interpreters, which get very conceptually tricky later on in the course, but are also very fun problem-solving wise, and give you a better idea of what exactly gcc is doing every time you compile your code. There's also a significant amount of de-abstraction -- consideration of real-life hardware, discussion of assembly language, and exploring how a functional language actually works on hardware. These topics were covered only briefly though -- I expect there are entire upper-year courses dedicated to them. The switch from CS 135 into 146 was quite easy, and a very smooth transition. There may be a couple unfamiliar features in full Racket that aren't taught in 135, but they're easy to catch on to. If you found 135 easy/boring, definitely give 146 a shot.

I also hate how the profs keep writing code on paper, since there were many typos in the code.

The C questions are a lot more doable, but beware of the memory and pointer stuff, or your program won't even compile. Also I learned to limit my debugging time by the end, and set up a threshhold (like 8/10) above which I only perfect my solutions when I feel like it. The return truly deminishes dramatically.

We had to build a neural network from scratch, with almost no help from the lectures or slides, a task that could've been done with keras in 5 minutes, as part of one assignment.

If you are not naturally talented at drawing, be prepared to waste 3-5 hours every week per assignment and still get 50s and 60s every week. The standards are insanely high, and you'll normally have about 5 assignments every week form this half of the course alone. Freehands are definitely the worst form of torture brought upon form 1A. They're not even worth your time as you'll run out of time studying for every other class. AutoCAD and Solidworks are also taught in this class, but those assignments still take hours and hours to complete for subpar grades. The quizzes are also nearly impossible to prepare for. Overall, this course may destroy your average explicitly, or implicitly from the hours you wasted on it. It will be far easier to boost your average by doing even better in all of your other classes.

In regards to the lab, there are a few assignments, one where you had to draw and label, which I loved. A few other \"assignments\" were quizzes where you were given pictures of different parts of animals focused on their anatomy, like the adductor muscle of a clam, and had to fill in the blank as to what the part was called. Lastly, can't forget about the fish dissection! Most students were required to purchase a fish and follow instructions on how to dissect it, take photos, and label it.

I suggest making cue cards with the different phyla names on them so you can practice them throughout the term (they're key to knowing what midterm and exam questions are talking about). The exam wasn't too bad if you studied hard for it. The lab component of the course was super useful and gave you hand on experience with some of the animals that you talk about in lecture. I recommend reading through lecture slides and the lab manual before going into the lab since there are lab quizzes after every dissection. The lab exam is extremely difficult so start studying early. It's a powerpoint presentation where they show you a pictures of organisms that you looked at in the lab with arrows pointing to something (often to what seems like nothing) and they ask 2-4 simple questions on it (like \"what is this structure\", \"what phyla is this from\" etc).

If I recall correctly there's a little section on converting numbers between decimal and binary number systems. This was insanely easy for me, simply because I knew my POWERS of TWO. Memorize them up to at least 2^10 and this will be a breeze. (Also knowing powers of two comes in handy for MANY applications down the road). The last thing comes back to matrices. You will hear the words Gaussian Elimination and Gauss-Jordan Elimination, and Row Echelon Form, and Reduced Row Echelon Form thrown around all over the place. Also \"forward elimination. backward substitution\". Learn explicitly what these things actually mean and what the differences are, so you can forget about all the silly words and just Do It.

The first tutorial was interestingly called a \"math review\" while introducing us to a great deal of new material revolving around complex numbers in a panic inducing rush. The tests were rather comical in how much they needed to be curved in order to get a somewhat reasonable average out of a total lack of understanding of the class for pretty much half the material, even with the generous grading. The entire unit of general relativity was so outlandishly beyond us, to the point it was wholly an exercise in futility, something professor Mann seemed to recognize, and assured us would not be tested on. And yet, a long and difficult graded assignment was still issued on it. I can understand showing us a general intro to GR's concepts, but actually going into its mathematics is ridiculous. What I did learn in this course was incredible and wonderful, and made it all the more unfortunate that such could not be done justice because this course tries to condense all of the frontiers of physics into a single course for first years.

The twice weekly quizzes had typos frequently, to get them right you had to guess whether or not it was an implication or typo. Textbook was useless, to understand I used another prof's course notes. We were forced to use Perusall, for which we were marked for \"productiveness\" of our conversations. Also the system tracking reading time underreported. The textbook was terrible, had too many typos (Linear Alg with Applications by Holt) had frequent wrong proofs. We were never actually taught how to do proofs despite class being supposedly an introduction. What would be one theorem in another class is 3+ in this textbook. This is very annoying when every assignment has you cite the EXACT theorem or definition number over and over, which wasted so much time. We had to do 3-4 textbook chapters/week no matter what, even if certain fundamental concepts that in other classes would be given an extra week were just zoomed through. Assignments had way too many questions, and hugely variable in time taken. Like 30+ random textbook questions every week. No joke, I spent 10 hours straight on an assignment and still didn't finish it. Most questions required ridiculous numbers of computations where each individual step had to be written down. The midterm had two typos, one was minor and the other fundamentally changed a question. She did not update the crowdmark with the fixed version, but sent out an email just slightly before the midterm saying the mistakes. Other than that was a fair exam. The final was impossible, it seemed like random questions out of the textbook with no regard to total time taken, where fundamental understanding was barely tested. I doubt the professor even made a key. By the end of the course there were 18 students left, 9 failed the exam.

The lectures were really boring, which motivated about half the class to never even show up. Those that did attend every lecture didn't seem to understand the content any better though. The tutorials rarely ever reflected the content learned in the week, and labs were difficult when the material hadn't been covered in class yet.

There could even be a question on the exam requiring you to use a brand new equation you've never seen before found on the messiest equation sheet possible. So ultimately, even if you actually manage to self-teach yourself the entire course, you may still get royally screwed. Textbooks for this subject are just as bad as the lectures. It's just pages and pages of conceptual ideas, and then just a bunch of numerical calculations you have no idea how to do. Often they require you to make wild assumptions or just happen to memorize certain values about a property you would normally look for in a chart.

Yeah right, what does this even mean. a 10 mark short answer question should probably appear once on a final not 6 times.

Mungo is more into the overall processes and how things work - both professors are great. I would recommend watching the supplementary material they post to reinforce your understanding. To get the most out of the course, make sure you follow up every lecture by making your own set of notes and watching extra youtube videos to supplement. The MOST IMPORTANT thing about a course like this is to NOT FALL BEHIND! Everything builds on itself, so attend class and stay on top of it. Make sure you nail down definitions and can label diagrams! When studying try to grasp the overall processes going on, understand that most of the time it is a pathway of simple reactions - you will see them several times in this general format: ligand binds to receptor which activates protein which turns off a repressor and allows a transcription factor to work (pathways are very easy to pull questions from, questions like explain how the pathway works OR what happens when you mutate a certain component of it, for example). Do the study questions as a self test after you studied each lecture set, you don't have to work them out you should be able to explain them to yourself.

It was interesting though to learn about the hierarchy of languages and finally understand how people can prove that something is not computable (that is, even if we had infinite computing resources, we could not solve some problem; I always wondered how we could know that). This module made an interesting complement to CS 341 which I was taking concurrently. Overall, I think it's a course worth taking for a richer understanding of computability, but perhaps not if you are only concerned with software engineering and practical stuff.

These will make you fall asleep because they are more dull than your grandfather telling you the same newspaper article for the 8th time. You will see approximately 40 equations that sometimes match with the content they've been plopped into. The most useless ones are the most useful. 2. Light frosting of lectures that tip-toe over the top of the pit that is the textbook work. Will possibly have an example that doesn't relate to the assigned questions, and won't actually show how to approach it. Just a question, then a final answer. No steps in-between. 3. Assigned questions from the textbook. These sometimes give you values, and then other ones you have to assume. The assumptions will lose you marks, but the questions cannot be solved without them. You'll look at these questions and not understand them, so you'll try going through the textbook chapters only to find they don't help at all. So you answer roughly half the questions with a half-baked equation mess, learning absolutely nothing. 4. You get your assignment back with a grade of 45%, so you check the assignment solutions, only to see some of your answers are surprisingly the exact same as the solution set posted yet you only got 0.5/2 with no indication what you did right or wrong. They also have nothing to do with the chapter you read. 5. Rinse and repeat until enough students complain and get told it's their fault they don't understand the content and don't know how to approach problems they weren't taught how to approach.

Keep an eye on your equipment and don't break/lose them (you don't wanna end up paying for them they are expensive) Final words/Personal Experience: Heidi scares me but if you follow the above tips you should do fine. Your TAs will be your best friends in this lab get on their good side. Most TAs are really nice so that shouldn't be a problem. Personally I did pretty well in this lab thanks to those tips.

The proofs had a seemingly rigid, unique grading scheme which was supposed to assign a grade based on the quality of your proof, rather than specific marks for whether you included something from the model solution. On paper, this sounded really nice, yet in practice, I would get wildly different results. Complete proofs which were correct except for maybe one major logical flaw near the end would receive 30% (which is explicitly stated to be for partial solutions). Meanwhile, actual partial solutions which were outright missing key information would receive, in some cases, 80% (which is stated to be what their posted model solutions get...?).

However, when you get a question wrong it does not tell you which questions you got wrong so it's hard to know what area you are lacking knowledge in and which questions to reattempt, thus it's a tedious cycle of retrying each question until you get all questions correct. Furthermore, we had tests every single week that was available from Monday-Wednesday, but you would not be able to access the tests unless you complete the weekly quizzes (due Sunday night).

I personally found the tutorials especially helpful when doing the quizzes since the TA reviewed everything taught and was clearer in explanations. Overall, the course was really useful though.

The reason why a lot of people likely thought that this course was easy, is because there is a circulating google doc that has all the previous midterms/tests in it. Therefore, if you have an extensive social group, you were bound to get the doc early, and study only according to the doc, and therefore were likely to get a solid 100% for solely memorizing what you knew would be tested. However, if you are like me, and had to do it the old fashioned way and try to study everything and only focusing heavily on the stuff that he stressed in class, it is a much different story.

IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, CXCL7, CTLA-4, CD45, CD40L etc) with little effort in class to tie everything together. Midterm averages were in the 60 range, unsurprisingly.

Additionally, some concepts that would benefit from images you'd have to Google or look through the textbook to understand (Things like convexity, n-cubes, discontinuities on Q as well as partitions I struggled with in the lectures before looking up and immediately understanding). Live or in person lectures would allow you to actually ask questions, which would be great because it's clear Prof. Cheng understands the concepts very well. Assignments are very tough as well and required 2-3 days just to complete, though at least the grading was pretty fair.

The professor in his pre recorded lectures would start writing proofs down and pull some random delta out of nowhere and would not bother to explain why he chose that value for delta or why we couldn't pick a different value for delta over the one he chose. The professor gave no intuition at all which honestly sucks in an analysis course because without any intuition , it is hard to grasp the theory well besides just remember random definitions. Office hours did not help either so that wasn't a good sign. I learned more about boundaries and sets in 237 in a week rather than a whole course in 333. This class mentions they prepare you for 351 but after how this class went for this term... I feel I was better off just going in to 351 without 333 since this course did not help at all.

Some of the things that we focused on in 362 will be less important here such as stock options benefit, auto benefit, what to include/exclude for employment income...and so on. After the midterm, however, many new concepts were introduced and it was so crammed with so many new things that the course was quite hard to catch up on. Something like AOC, Associated Corps, SRED, income vs. capital, could really be difficult to understand. For these new concepts, there were only like 1 practice question per concept (and the question is hard), so it's really hard to study for them. You really need to do your questions. The second part of the course was focused on concepts and our final had like no calculation (calculators weren't needed near the end). It was very strange. Midterm was a lot of calculation though. For your final, you need to memorize everything and take good notes on what he says in class. You really have to go to class. Finally, Rogo snaked us in the end. We all dropped like 10%. Maybe the average was too high (76% for midterm), or the assignments average was too high, he marked our final exams really hard. The final was really easy but the average was probably around 60%.

So, I will use some of it here and just add a few points here there, so you know what makes this course really STAND OUT. THIS IS THEEEEE WORST COURSE I have ever taken and the most hated class in 2A for my cohort. The lectures were sooo\u2026\u2026\u2026.boring and useless, which motivated most of the class to never show up. The textbook is completely useless as well, just pages and pages of conceptual ideas, and then just a bunch of numerical calculations you have no idea how to do. Often, they require you to make wild assumptions or just happen to memorize certain values about a property you would normally look for in a chart. The book barely and I mean barely skims the topic and then it tells you to google the rest for yourself. The tutorials are literally questions from the textbook, which usually does not relate to what it spoke about. The labs were poorly designed; students are sometimes required to buy or search for household items to carry out the experiment. The lab manual always presents a cheap, flimsy experimental setup in the form of a picture with very little organized and comprehensible instruction on how to actually set it up and carry out the procedure, which just of course led to way too many experimental errors, and thus the least accurate data possible. Many large concepts that were repeatedly mentioned throughout the course didn't show up once on the exams. Meanwhile, memorizing random things like the type of material that reading lenses are made of is required for the test. Funnily enough, such random facts, are only shown one time, on this one slide, in this one lecture for a minute. There are even questions on the exam requiring you to use brand-new equations you've never used before, found somewhere on the slides, possibly in the tiniest writing, and with zero explanation as to what each variable in the equation means. So ultimately, even if you manage to self-teach yourself the entire course, you may still get royally screwed. To top it off this teacher will ask you to purchase anything for his class, including software with no notice. Day of the class, prof waltzes in, telling us we need to buy a peer grading software for $30 to submit our assignments, oh and the first assignment, which we were also just hearing about, was due the following day\u2026\u2026\u2026. the hell! Did you realize that I said, \u201cpeer grading software\u201d? So yes, students are marking and evaluating other students\u2019 work and providing feedback to those evaluations. In the end, the prof and Tas will still mark your work and bring down the grade that the students gave you. Thus making this platform a complete waste of your time and money, particularly since there are platforms that other teachers use at this school to do the same thing for free. No surprise that many students were failing his quizzes, especially when there were so few questions on the quiz to do in even lesser time. One question easily translates to 4.5% - 10% of your grade. What makes this better is that for calculation questions, you have to get the EXACT number in order to get the answer correct, so if you have 0.0025 and he has 0.0026, you just lost 10%. Did I mention that if you cumulatively fail the quizzes, you fail the course? He will automatically fail you. All grades aside from the quiz grades become NULL AND VOID, they won\u2019t count towards your final average. So you, my friend would have double wasted your money on that software and all materials you bought for the labs, all the time and effort you spent doing the other course work would have been for nothing. Just in case you are hoping for a curve, get that out of your mind right now. THERE IS NO CURVE, however, you may be selected for an interview where you get 20 mins to make a speech, and/ or be grilled with questions about the different topics that made up the quiz you failed. If you do well on the interview, who knows, you may get 3% added to your failed quiz. This is a one-time thing, so I hope you won't fail more than one quiz and I for sure hope that if you do fail one that it was only like a 47% on that quiz.

The course starts off by reviewing frictional losses, and Bernoulli's Energy Equation from ME 351. After the midterm, the course shifts focus on pneumatics. This is the chapter where you will be designing cascaded pneumatic systems with multiple piston/cylinders that follow a sequence of retractions/expansions. Following pneumatics, the course shifts focus on modelling of hydraulic systems. Modelling is quite straightforward since you will be deriving the plant transfer function, and determining the gain, natural frequency, fluid 'spring' stiffness, etc. The final chapter involves implementing PLCs from waaaaay back in ME 262 to simplify hydraulic and pneumatic systems. Although this is a great course, I wish that the Instructor could squeeze in a chapter on hydrokinetic transmission systems without us having to take ME 563 (Turbomachines).

He keeps preaching about how he wants us to learn and employ a good design process, but whenever you even mention machine learning he goes insane and starts ranting about how ML is unreliable and unattainable in this course. He is so opinionated and biased. I'm constantly shocked at the feedback he gives, it's so random, everything is so up in the air. Don't expect a good mark. Don't expect to get rewarded for your efforts. Don't expect to learn anything. Might as well do the bare minimum to do his stupid deliverables and focus on actual courses.

The rest of this dumb course was just completing useless deliverables that take a crazy amount of time, don't actually help with design, and you may do poorly on no matter how hard you try. Also, just don't try asking for help. The TAs this term created such a hostile learning environment. They criticize and put down every group's progress, don't clearly answer questions, and are just unhelpful. The information they give is unreliable, many groups got marks off for stuff the TAs said is okay. You can't listen to anyone. And don't ask Borland for help. He just says stuff that means nothing. He just gets philosophical about his outlook on life and design and never answers anything.

However, the soc was incredibly specific, to the point where they were pretty much just telling us what to do. They forced us to delegate tasks in a very strict manner. You were discouraged from trying to do a bit of everything or even use each other's testing data. Marking has also been a mess. There are no rubrics, so most marks are just arbitrarily taken off and feedback is haphazard and stale. Instructions for deliverables are incredibly brief and open ended, but marking is very stringent. Furthermore the goal of this course is very unclear because we are not suppose to even achieve a functional prototype, despite being a prototyping course.

Each week you come together to make a bunch of decisions about a business you are running, and honestly it's stressful since you get assigned your own department (R&D, Marketing, Production, or Finance) to manage. Overall I think it was just so tiring (especially as an introvert) because basically, the entire class is weekly group work. The breakdown is like 35% Individual (presentation and modules) stuff and 65% group work (forecast model, 2 presentations and balance scorecard that depends on how well you do in the simulation so you can't just mess around). I find that it is a lot to keep track of especially if you're a full-time student, there is a lot for an online course, but it does simulate like a real-life business experience. Also capsim is kinda dumb like it's a lot of guesstimating honestly, and the way it calculates things are weird too.

Our final exam on derivatives, had no derivatives in it and was rather a strategies case like AFM433.

Often they were 3-4 questions. 1-2 questions would be related to the course content, the other 1-2 would be to design something assine in Matlab. On EVERY assignment the questions were out of scope on course content and difficulty. Despite all of this, the course would still have been okay if not for one thing. The prof, did he even exist? The class would email him frequently with questions on course content and assignments and he just wouldn't respond. Ever. WEEKS later you might be lucky to get a response. My favorite example was when he posted the final exam, it was blank for everyone, and then he just disappeared for 4 hours.

Had a few quizzes where Georgia would sign something and we would have to write down what it meant. Kind of like a spelling test. Had a research paper where we wrote about ASL, some homework assignments (usually summarizing something from the reading or an activity from the textbook), self-assessments (you just fill out a scale), a final video where you tell a story in ASL, and a final dialogue where you're partnered up with somebody from the class and you basically review everything you've learned in the format of a dialogue.

Also, unlike other courses where you don't really learn much new material, the CBV program is new knowledge and you'd be learning a lot. Valuation is an essential skill in both accounting and finance fields, and the CBV designation (plus its career aspects) is growing every year.

I'd much rather focus on the technicals (like 611, 650, 680). Our students are really weak on day 3 cases and we've never had integrated cases, instead of talking about our feelings and bsing questions in-class, I much rather have discussions on FR issues (IFRS15, IFRS16 and IFRS9). Exam strategies and time management comes naturally when you understand the technical concepts and when you do more cases, but technical stuff we need the profs to help us. Greg is super strong in Assurance and I think it's really waste for him to ask everyone's feelings. Instead, we could focus on procedures/assertions (which everyone is weak at).

It's essentially an Online Course but I cannot gather any interests for it, since the readings, teachings, and assignments are useless. The readings do not reinforce the required work. I did all my assignments without having to read anything. The teachings were also not necessary since I did not attend a single lecture. The fact that there were literally no expectations for students to show up or care (since you're capped at 80%) is a big turnoff for students. The readings were lengthy, boring, outdated, and not interesting at all. Most assignments are full of typos and as if someone came up with them last minute. The entire course is focused on such a niche area of law, yet it's so simple that I can essentially do the entire course in 1 week. Most students did their submissions by the first half of the course, and did nothing (thus learned nothing) for the 2nd half, and the instructor made little efforts to make us learn. The instructor fails to invoke our interests in the course and he doesn't care about our well-being either. Instructor refuses any regrades and claims that he's \"busy\" and declines meetings with students who wish to improve, despite only teaching 2 courses. If you cannot commit to teach (due to side projects or research), then don't teach. Our tuition in MAcc is high, and we do not want a course that adds no value to our professional careers. The students who marked our assignments and papers are not even Waterloo students. Fairness & objectivity in grading is a serious flaw in this course. There was absolutely no feedback provided when you get marks taken off. People often ask, \"are these TAs even qualified to mark our assignments\"? I bet as a MAcc student, we write better than them, yet they are taking marks off for grammar and other unknown reasons. Every class, MAcc students repeatedly complain to Charters that we don't understand his rationale of capping everyone at 80%. If we deserve a 100%, and there's no way to improve any further, then we deserve 100%. The forced distribution system placed upon the class really discourages the students who wanted to work hard. The students have the mentality that, \"no matter what you do, you're going to get a 80% anyways\". The students who do all the readings, spent hours researching and compiling, gets the same mark as a student who crammed everything in 1 hour.

Brad shows mercy to his students and curves the grades, despite it being not too bad in the first place. Compared to Berberich, I honestly thought we were lucky to have Brad who was excellent in every way in terms of teaching, and caring for his students. This course was not hard, yet you learn incredible amounts of FR and Assurance standards and case applications. It perfectly integrates with ACC611 standards and you essentially get extra practice on the FR issues while doing your weekly homework. I highly recommend taking 650 because it prepares you well for CFE, as opposed to PM or Finance.

ACC685 is CPA elective and is supposed to be a much enhanced version of ACC680, yet Zamal only focuses on the strategy part and nothing on cost or quants and the course is entirely full of bs. A simple strategy case that could have been taught in 1 lecture is split into 3 full classes, you literally learn nothing. The cases are outdated, long, and made no sense (because it was not written for CPA purposes, but for MBA Harvard/Ivey) Zamal is actually very lazy and he makes no effort in updating course material and claims that nothing has changed over the past 20 years and therefore we use the slides from 20 years ago. Also, he tries to bs his way out whenever he doesn't know the answers, which occurs often. Many of us took this course because we heard it was \"bird\". This is not the case this year. What happened is that Zamal was too lazy and he didn't change the midterm/final from the previous year, so the entire class from the year before got 90s. For our year, he totally screwed us over by making 2 hard cases for midterm and gave us all low marks for participation, assignment, and exams. By the way, he makes \"C\" only a 90%, so even if you get a \"C\" on your case, which is under CPA standards - perfect score, you won't get a 100% on your case. He's effectively capping your performance at 90% (max you'll get), and he makes RC a 70% when it's supposed to be a 75%. This course DOES NOT help you prepare your CFE. If you think you're going to take PM role, then just spend more effort on 680 with Nancy and Janet because you learn more from them. There are not many PM role cases available since CFE started in 2015, but he makes no effort to make it better. He could have asked Nancy and used some of her cases or modified them, or just use CPA cases, but no, he just continued using the previous prof's cases because he's that lazy. He also never replies his email, and never holds office hours (since he commutes). Good luck trying to reach him for help because he's not willing to.
