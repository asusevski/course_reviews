Although things were nicely organized, Racket was such an annoying language to use. The one tangible benefit I felt after using Racket was feeling more comfortable with recursion."}, {"id": 2, "review": "It starts with a very low pace but after midterm, it gets really fast and I cannot understand the content while reaching the end of term. Racket is restricted by so many things so I feel I lose the freedom of coding. The assignments are extremely hard after midterm, I spent a whole day on them but I can just solve the easiest one. The only positive impression that I have is that the design recipe weighs half so I pass this course successfully."}, {"id": 3, "review": "Took this in 2018 with no programming experience ever.

It's seriously well structured and I would recommend it to anyone even with no background in coding."}, {"id": 5, "review": "I recommend finding a course with a language that is actually useful. Racket is dumb and never used anywhere. The majority of the course was quite easy, except a couple of concept checks that were RIDICULOUSLY HARD. i wish i had realized sooner that you get 10% of concept checks dropped from your grade. if you understand everything and are getting most things easily but you get stumped on one particular concept check, its probably not your fault and you should skip it, at least for now. the course was very well structured and predictable. expectations were clear and reasonable. it actually was designed to be a correspondence course, so it wasnt an online course that was rushed and slapped together for covid."}, {"id": 6, "review": "I really enjoyed this course online, being co-taught by 4 professors. There were lots of office hours available to help and all of the TA's and Profs in office hours were helpful and kind. While the programming language used is not useful elsewhere, I think it is easy to understand and helped get the point of the course across. In my opinion, the point of this course is to teach you to think about solving problems and the process to go through, as you are not creating ground-breaking programs. As a student with no prior programming experience, I found this course both useful and easy if you kept up with the content and got help as soon as you needed it. The course was organized well, and the built in questions made sure you were on the right track. The assignments are fair based on what you learn. Go in with an open mind and keep up with the content and you should be just fine."}, {"id": 7, "review": "math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. the course isn't horribly hard, but if you fall behind or don't understand one lesson, everything following will be super challenging. the course was mostly online completing modules, and my biggest criticism is that solutions for lessons are never posted after they are due which makes it super challenging to do the next week's module if you didn't understand/didnt know how to write a specific code for the week. the racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful and isn't used anywhere. this makes it difficult to find help outside of cs115 profs/ta's/past cs115 students. the course is oddly paced, felt the super easy and simple first half of the course, and then gets unreasonably fast. didn't find any of the profs/ta's answers to questions posted on discussion boards useful at all. because the course was only offered online, I had to essentially had to teach the whole course to myself"}, {"id": 8, "review": "The only way to do bad in this course is by not managing ur time properly. This is a mistake I made when we had to work with modules. As long as u properly manage ur time and do assignments and concept checks well before the due date, you will have a great time in this course. Also try finding connections between assignments and try finding some real world applications of racket. Trust me Racket is very useful. The only criticism I have of this course is how the course is taught because it wasn't taught. (this is when I did online.) I had to understand all concepts by myself by basically reading texts. Although There was plenty of opportunity like office hours to ask for help, I only realized that towards the end of the term. Very unfortunate :("}, {"id": 9, "review": "Can be difficult at times, but a very rewarding and fun course. Definitely made me like CS as a non-CS student!

Overall, as someone who is not a CS student and who doesn't have a lot of background experience and knowledge in programming, it's a great introductory course to the language of Racket and the overall concepts that will be useful in later computer science courses. The Racket language itself is not a very \"useful\" language that you may or may not use in later CS courses and even in a job, but the foundation it provides is very valuable and will definitely make you think more mathematically at programming problems. The difficulty of this course starts to increase after the midterm exam, and it does get pretty tough nearing the end. I recommend starting the assignments as early as possible and attend as many office hours if you have any questions. The course staff are very responsive and do offer a good amount of help depending on your questions.

The EDx is clearly organized, and the content isn't too difficult, but provides a challenge. Can't speak to the in-person, but would definitely recommend the online. Beware though as this course is time consuming because of the amount of problems and assignments and shouldn't be mixed with a term that is already fairly difficult."}, {"id": 14, "review": "This was joint taught by a bunch of profs in the Winter term and I think it was one of the most organized online courses I took. The content modules were all written but there was a bunch of integrated questions to check your understanding. The course is really centered on your ability to reach out for help when you need it since everything was asynchronous. I think my favourite part was how office hours were 1-on-1 and there were a lot of times available throughout the day. The only thing is that some of the nicer TAs had really long wait times lol. Overall super enjoyable though, just make sure to base your design recipe on their given examples or you will lose many marks"}, {"id": 15, "review": "I think this course ran well online, the notes were very organized and easy enough to follow along and there is good support from most of the proffs and tas.

They are least interested to teach. They just provided the content to read by ourselves. I wouldn't suggest anyone to take this course online."}, {"id": 17, "review": "Nice course that teaches you how to write simple code. But little annoying that you have to do Design Recipe (especially writing an explanation for codes). There is no loop in DrRacket so being able to understand recursion is important.

So far I think those who can just play computer games (i.e. no coding experience but can easily type using the keyboard) can easily get 90+ in this course. If you have ever coded like C, python, java, pascal and so on, easy to get 95+. Idk why the easy rate goes so low but trust me, super easy course if you finish reading the material (okay reading part may be a little boring and CS 135 provide detailed intros which seem not wordy)"}, {"id": 18, "review": "It was okay. All I can say is, do your work and submit assessments on time. Please don't procrastinate. That's what I did, and I live to regret it.

For me, I believe the material we learn and the assignment we need to do is inconsistent in terms of difficulty level. The gap between them is just huge.

Speaking of assignment, they're bloody hard! No joke, it might take you an entire day to problem solve your way through them and that might not even be enough - incredibly frustrating course and not recommended unless you really want to study coding in the future.

What I liked about this course it that it has many applications and that it was more computational based rather than strictly proof based. The course notes are quite useful and there are a lot of practise problems they give you that will help you feel more prepared for exam and even your upcoming assignments. I really like that the course notes are detailed as well. With that being said here are the things I did not like about the course... The course is basically a \"teach it yourself course\". There are weekly mini lectures you can watch which provide maybe 30-40% of the lesson where as you're expected to read the course notes as well because just going off the mini lectures will not help you with much of the quizzes unfortunately. Meaning that there are quiz topics that aren't covered in the Mobius but that are discussed from the notes. For the assignments, they aren't bad they are just annoying since a lot of it is done in R and I am more of a solve by hand guy rather than software. What I mainly did not like about the course again, was the fact it was more of a self learning course and that there weren't any live classes, or extra weekly live tutorials for online students.

I would say this is definitely easier than MATH 138 though. The concepts were not super interesting since I really only enjoy applied CS stuff hahaha, but it was not dry and boring either. The one aspect I really liked about this course is that it is applied, there were not any proof questions whatsoever which was superb. If you enjoy something applied and are at least somewhat interested in data science, you would enjoy this course. My complaint about this course is that it felt like you literally self-taught yourself in this course, the instructors will not help you on the assignments (at least in my offering). There were lecture video and weekly recap but I found the course note to be your best bet to learn the materials as it explained concepts thoroughly with so many examples and practice problems (which make me happy since some math class just assume you know a lot or are proficient enough at math, def not me haha).

I do not know which prof woke up one day and was like we are not going to allow them to go back to a question and also block access to Piazza during exams so that not even private posts can be made.

If you want 95+, my advice is to not watch the lectures (too long), just read the course notes as they are explained in more detail and contain some great advanced questions that will get you prepared for the hard questions that you may encounter in quizzes or the exams. The assignments are very straightforward, so do not stress too much by the amount (they are quite long), but make sure you study LOTS!

Some had very few (useful) examples, and others had nothing but examples. The only \"lectures\" we had were a few short 2-5 minute videos about particular slides where they typically just went over the example on the slide, or maybe added in some additional information for said slide.

Essentially, around 3/4 of this course is covered in high school with a little more toughness in the test questions. I personally found this course to be on the easier side but it gets confusing at the end of the term with the new integration content. A few tips for this course is to do the practice midterm and exam problems that are provided, it is highly likely that a question or two from the practice problem sheet may show up on an assessment, or a question very similar. Attend office hours if you are confused. University math can be a big jump for people and topics can be hard to understand, which is why asking your professor/TA is the best option to clear up any confusion and will only benefit you in the end.

He is extremely passionate about microbiology and provides the students with many different resources to help them succeed (recordings of each lecture, animations, and supplementary information for topics covered in class).

The final exam is much easier than the midterm and an overall 80%+ in this course is very achievable. Personally, I found it most helpful to attend lecture and just listen and then rewatch the videos and take notes from that since I could understand the material at my own pace. Neufeld also uploads practice quizzes (doesn't count towards grades) to help you review material for each powerpoint. These are somewhat helpful, and most of the questions come straight from the textbook. You DO NOT need to purchase a textbook for the course. When studying for the midterm and final, MAKE SURE to review the clicker questions he has asked throughout the year (he will post them on learn), they are very representative of the level of difficulty to expect, and some of the questions are very similar or even the same as what you would see on the actual exams.

The content came directly from the slides and from the profs lecture, just be sure to take detailed notes.

Lectures were clear and alongside the textbook the concepts were introduced in an excellent manner. I actually understood electrical laws and circuits for the first time ever, and even enjoyed doing them. The course was fun, and aside from the 8:30am starting time, it was fully worth it.
