However, that was the most childish a wanna be theoretical physicist can tell himself. A lot of what you will learn in this course will be useful as it will be the foundation of the mathematics you will need to solve a lot of theoretical physics problems. A lot of what u learn in this course is also useful in proving equations u derive as a physicist. You will learn things like Complex numbers, Methods of Proof, The Binomial Theory, Summations and repeated multiplications. All of these concepts are useful for example when we try to approximate equations in Physics, a good understanding of Summations is required. Binomial theory may be used to expand Relativistic kinetic energy equation. Lets say u as a mathematical physicist derived an equation some how. Now u want to make sure that the equation is valid, a basic knowledge of what u learn in this course may be helpful. Complex numbers can be spotted in Schrodinger's Wave Equation. If u are serious about physics, don't take this course lightly. Although this might be an over exaggeration but I feel like this course is as important as Calculus. So In calculus you will be asked to derive Taylor polynomials, how will you do that without a basic understanding of Summations? Although the science mathematical physics students donot have to take this course before taking math 136 (linear algebra for honours math), this course is very useful in math 136. The proof techniques you learn in this course like Proof by Strong induction may be useful in Linear algebra. And all physics enthusiasts know the importance of linear algebra in physics. One can finish most of math 137 (calculus) assignments without having to look at lectures (I donot recommend this) and get a good grade. You cannot even solve the first question in math 135 before fully understanding all concepts in the lectures. I personally very much disliked this course mostly because the math learned was very new compared to what I was taught in school and it was difficult to understand these ideas. But I did enjoy learning about the new concepts. but I understand that the content taught is very important. Therefore, if u are an apprising physicist, take the course seriously. If u like pure math take this course seriously, if u like CS take this course seriously. If u like Finance take this course seriously. If u like painting take this course seriously (u need to understand the golden ratio to figure out how to make ur art perfect). Regardless of ur major, please don't undermine the value this course provides. This course sucks no doubt, but it is hella useful so pay attention in class and do all assignments even though u can drop one. A criticism I would have with this course is the lack of applications. Although this course content has many applications the course is designed in a way that suggests that there is none except in pure math. I would like that to change. And if possible please make a physics based Math135 and math 136 please and thankyou.", "course_rating": "disliked course"}, {"review_text": "Incredibly helpful for anyone who wants to develop a more profound understanding of the fundamental components of algebra.", "course_rating": "liked course"}, {"review_text": "The most difficult course in my 1A.
